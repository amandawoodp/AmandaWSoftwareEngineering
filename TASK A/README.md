# QuickFit
## by Amanda Wood

**Explanation**
My project is an application that creates personalized workouts depending on the time and implements the user has.
It has a data base of 18 different excersices, that have their own attributes: number, name of the excercise, implements needed, time and priority. This way, the user specifies how much time and implements they have and the program filters the excersices, providing a work out that suits the user's needs.

**Progress**
I developed the main window and the second window where the user can answer the questions. I also implemented the filter logic for the excercises. I still need to implement the third window, where the work out is going to be shown. Also, I need to work on the design details. 

**How to run the programm**
First of all, open a terminal on the frontend window. In my computer I use the command: ( /Users/amandawood/.local/pipx/venvs/pyqt6/bin/python main.py ) to make it run. You need to have PyQt6 downloaded, but since it was not working on my computer I had to download it with pipx. If it is working porperlly in your computer, you should just type python3 main.py in the same terminal.
