# QuickFit
## by Amanda Wood

**Explanation**
My project is an application that creates personalized workouts depending on the time and implements the user has.
It has a data base of 18 different excersices, that have their own attributes: number, name of the excercise, implements needed, time and priority. This way, the user specifies how much time and implements they have and the program filters the excersices, providing a work out that suits the user's needs.

**How to run the programm**
As I mentioned in the requierments, to run my code in your computer you would need to have PyQt6 installed, so [I recorded a video that shows the program functionalities.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i_0IBojwqJu2RHTIZmfCp6TdqG6BRB3W/view?usp=sharing)
In case you have everything downloaded: First of all, open a terminal on the project. In my computer I use the command: ( /Users/amandawood/.local/pipx/venvs/pyqt6/bin/python main.py ) to make it run. You need to have PyQt6 downloaded, but since it was not working on my computer I had to download it with pipx. If it is working properlly in your computer, you should just type python3 main.py in the same terminal. This way the program would start running and you can start interacting with it
